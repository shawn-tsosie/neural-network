STEPS OF NEURAL NETWORK
1. Pre-process
		a. Normalize Training Set
		b. Shuffle Training Set
2. Train Neural Network
		a. Initialize Weights (Keep track of them in a list)
		b. Begin mini-batch ADAM for some number of epochs
			 Do the following until all elements of the training set are used.
				i. 		Feed-forward (Keep track of Loss)
				ii. 	Back-Prop	
				iii.	Update Weights via ADAM algorithm.
3. Evaluate Test Loss via predict function
